This repository ties the yVideo project together.

Run the prep_env.sh script in order to download all of the needed repositories and to install docker and docker-compose. Currently, only Ubuntu and Fedora are supported when it comes to installing docker/docker-compose.

    usage:$ bash scripts/prep_env.sh <branch>

If the branch argument is present, the code repositories will be downloaded. The repositories will not be be downloaded otherwise. The branch argument should match master|develop which are the branch names that exist for every yVideo repository.

In addition to install docker/docker-compose and downloading the yvideo dependencies, yvideo and yvideo-dict-lookup will need completed application.conf files. Other required files are denoted by the required environment variables output at the bottom of the help text when the command `bash setup_yvideo.sh -h` is run.

The setup_yvideo.sh script manages all of the docker containers. Generally, the following containers are created:

    play application - https://github.com:BYU-ODH/yvideo
    play application - https://github.com:BYU-ODH/yvideo-dict-lookup
    httpd server
    mysql database

This repository ties the yVideo project together.

#A version of bash >= 4.0 is required for project setup
*DO NOT PUSH local yvideo_env file changes because it will break production*

Run the prep_env.sh script in order to download all of the needed repositories and to install docker and docker-compose. Currently, only Ubuntu and Fedora are supported when it comes to installing docker/docker-compose.

The prev_env script looks for a GITDIR environment variable where you would like all of the accompanying project to be downloaded to (used for development)


    usage:$ bash scripts/prep_env.sh <branch>

If the branch argument is present, the code repositories will be downloaded. The repositories will not be be downloaded otherwise. The branch argument should match master|develop which are the branch names that exist for every yVideo repository.

In addition to install docker/docker-compose and downloading the yvideo dependencies, yvideo and yvideo-dict-lookup will need completed application.conf files. Other required files are denoted by the required environment variables output at the bottom of the help text when the command `bash setup_yvideo.sh -h` is run.

1. Make sure that the dB env vars (YVIDEO_SQL & YVIDEO_SQL_DATA) have the correct path to the folders that contain sql database dumps by sourcing it to your bash shell environment 
2. You need to create the Yvideo sql data directory ie. sql_data
3. Copy application.conf.dev from yvideo-conf to the yvideo directory's conf folder and rename to application.conf
4. It might be helpful to change your .bashrc profile to include the YVIDEO_SQL & YVIDEO_SQL_DATA env vars (make sure to change the paths to work with your local setup)

The setup_yvideo.sh script manages all of the docker containers. Generally, the following containers are created:

    play application - https://github.com:BYU-ODH/yvideo
    play application - https://github.com:BYU-ODH/yvideo-dict-lookup
    httpd server
    mysql database

Quick start commands:
docker swarm init
./setup_yvideo.sh -h (If you need help)
./setup_yvideo.sh --dev --default --build --services=dv 

How to remove containers:
./setup_yvideo.sh --dev --remove
